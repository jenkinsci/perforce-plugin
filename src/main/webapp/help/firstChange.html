  <p>
    <b>First Changelist to Track</b>: allows you to specify the first changelist to start recording build
    history from.  If you are adding an existing project, with lots of history, to Hudson/Jenkins, this will
    prevent out of memory errors and your first build from having thousands of change records.

  <p>Note: this is reset after it has been applied once.</p>
