    <b>Views</b>: This is the depot to client mapping in the same depot-client pair format as a
    standard Perforce workspace spec, with a couple of handy shortcuts added: the workspace name
    provided in the second of each pair is not actually used--the actual workspace name is always
    substituted. And, the second member of any pair may be ommitted which will result in an
    identity mapping being used. ie, //depot/test/subdir/... will map to //workspace/test/subdir/...<br/>
    If "Let Hudson Manage Workspace View" is checked the view entered here will overwrite the view
    in the existing client.
  </p>
  <p>
    Typical examples that have the same meaning:<br>
    //depot/folder/... //workspace-name/folder/...<br>
    //depot/folder/... //anyplaceholder/folder/...<br>
    //depot/folder/...<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Note:</b>Parameter substitution of the form ${parametername} can be used anywhere in the view spec to substitute job parameters.</p>
