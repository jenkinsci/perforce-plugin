    <b>Don't rename workspace for each slave</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  	Perforce tracks changes for each workspace specification on the server. This
  	is how the server knows which files to update during a p4 sync.  This means 
  	that each physical workspace needs to have its own workspace specification 
  	to track it's own files.  To ensure a unique workspaces for each project 
  	across all the slaves we add the hostname of the slave to the end of the 
  	workspace name given in the "Workspace (client)" field.

  <p>
	If you do not want the plugin to automatically rename clients for each slave
	then check this box
