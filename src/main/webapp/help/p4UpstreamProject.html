    Sync to the changeset of another project.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a project name is entered here, the plugin will sync to the changeset
    of this other project last succesful build instead of the most recent
    changeset.
    This feature can be used for downstream jobs to sync to the same revision
    as the upstream job, for example when using copy artifact plugin to copy
    this project last succesful artifacts.
