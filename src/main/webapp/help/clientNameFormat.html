	In order for slaves to sync correctly, a different client workspace needs to be used for each. This box configures the client name that is used for the slaves. Be sure to read the important notes for the client name field in the configuration above.
  </p>
  <p>
    Supported tokens are:
<ul>
<li>${basename} - The client name as configured in the above section</li>
<li>${hostname} - The hostname of the slave</li>
<li>${hash} - The hash code of the slave name</li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <p>The recommended default value is "${basename}-${hash}" (without quotes).</p>
 <p> When set to the default ${basename} is used, and this also enables polling to occur on the master</p>
<p>This allows polling to occur without the last slave to be online</p>
