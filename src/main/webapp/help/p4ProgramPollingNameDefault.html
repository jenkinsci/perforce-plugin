<div>
  <p>
    Set what Program Name shall be reported to Perforce server when job is
    polling for new changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    This field's value will be used when polling for new changes.
    If not set, the value of "p4 Program Name" field will be used.
    Use it when you would like to have granular identification of what 
    connections are tied with polling and what with fetching sources.
    
    This is a global setting that will be used for all Jenkins jobs, unless 
    not explicitly overridden in job specific Perforce configuration.
    
    This option is overridden by both job specific settings related to this 
    feature, i.e. "p4 Program Polling Name" and "p4 Program Name".
    
    The effective value resolution order is:
    <pre>
    job specific p4 "Program Polling Name"
    else job specific p4 "Program Name"
    else global p4 "Program Polling Name"
    else global p4 "Program Name"
    </pre>
  </p>
</div>
