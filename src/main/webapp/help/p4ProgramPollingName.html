<div>
  <p>
    Set what Program Name shall be reported to Perforce server when job is 
    polling for new changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    This field's value will be used when polling for new changes.
    If not set, the value of "p4 Program Name" field will be used.
    Use it when you would like to have granular identification of what 
    connections are tied with polling and what with fetching stages.  
    
    There is also corresponding "p4 Program Default Polling Name" option at 
    Jenkins global configuration. Although before that is used, the local 
    "p4 Program Name", if set, takes precedence.
