    Set what Program Name shall be reported to Perforce server.

  <p>
    Setting this value will add extra option "-z prog=name" every time 
    p4 is connecting to the Perforce server. This can be later examined 
    with p4 monitor command by Perforce administrators.
    Useful to debug Perforce connections, group then together and identify 
    their source.
    
    This is a global setting that will be used for all Jenkins jobs, unless 
    not explicitly overridden in job specific Perforce configuration.
