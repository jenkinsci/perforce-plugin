    <b>Let Hudson/Jenkins Create Workspace</b>: For most cases, leave this checked.  Hudson/Jenkins will create
    the workspace from the project's settings provided below.

    If unchecked, you must create the workspace yourself.  If you have a separate tool for managing your workspace
    view, you may want to check this and uncheck letting Hudson/Jenkins manage your view.
