    <b>ClientSpec</b>: This is the path to a textual mapping file in the depot.
    The file has to contain a client mapping in the same depot-client pair format as a
    standard Perforce workspace view.

    If "Let Hudson/Jenkins Manage Workspace View" is checked the view entered here will overwrite the view
    in the existing client.
