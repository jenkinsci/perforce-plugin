    <b>One Time Force Sync</b>: allows you to tell this plugin to do a 'p4 sync -f //...' which
    will make sure to pull down ALL files to the workspace, regardless if they have been sync'd
    before.  Use this to get around problems where the Perforce workspace has become out of sync with
    the Perforce server.  For most users, you should never need to worry about this.
  </p>
  <p>Note: this is reset after it has been applied once.</p>
  <p><b>Important Note:</b> This option currently doesn't work when using matrix/multiconfiguration builds. Please use the 'Always Force Sync' option instead, and disable it when you are done.
