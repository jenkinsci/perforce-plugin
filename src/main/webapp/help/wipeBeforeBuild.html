    <b>Clean Workspace Before Build</b>: This option will cause the plugin to delete all files in the workspace before running a build. 
This option will also cause the plugin to perform a force sync to retrieve clean files from the perforce server.<br>
  </p>
  <p>This option can also be triggered by creating a boolean parameter on the build called "P4CLEANWORKSPACE".</p>
  <p><b>Important Note:</b> It is highly recommended that you enable this or the 'Always Force Sync' option when using a Matrix or 
    Multiconfiguration build. Failing to do so could cause child builds to not be synced properly.
