  <p>
	The View Mask is a list of depot paths in the form of:<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//depot/sample1/...<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//depot/sample2/...<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//depot/sample4*/*.java<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc...<br/>
    or local absolute paths in the form of:<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c:/jenkins/workspace/jobname/sample1/...<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c:/jenkins/workspace/jobname/sample2/....c<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc...<br/>
    or local relative paths in the form of:<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sample1/...<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sample2/....c<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc...<br/>
	As long as the paths are in the client view, they will be used instead
	of the entire client workspace spec when syncing and/or polling (see the checkboxes below). Parameters may be used in this field.
  </p>
  <p><b>Important Note:</b> When polling, the changes will be pulled from the depot specs provided, regardless of whether or not they are in the workspace spec. This means that if you specify a file or set of files that don't exist in the view, any changes made to them will trigger a build. It's also possible that builds will be triggered constantly. Use this option with caution.
